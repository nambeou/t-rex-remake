# t-rex-remake

This is my attempt to recreate the Dinosaur game on the Chrome.

There are a lot of things that still need to be fine-tuned for the game to correctly function, like the
jump distance, height and the interval between the enemy spawns.

However this project does have all the aspect that make the game run like it should, meaning the mechanisms for 
the player to jump, run and die when hit enemies.

This project is not supposed to be a complete game. Anyone interested is welcomed to use the code and modify to make it a game.
